# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

`agent-ui` is a zero-dependency, signals-based web-component library (one ruled exception: the opt-in
`@agent-ui/code/editor` surface adopts CodeMirror 6, lazy-loaded — ADR-0139; every default barrel stays
dependency-free) authored in strict, modern
TypeScript — carrying over the `rce` architecture: signals reactivity · FACE custom elements ·
tagged-template rendering · traits. First component family = FACE form controls.

Plan `.claude/docs/plan.md` · Goals + per-milestone DoD `.claude/docs/goals.md` · Roadmap (forward-looking, Now/Next/Later) `.claude/docs/roadmap.md` · Coherence process `.claude/docs/process.md` · Standards `.claude/docs/references/`

## Commands

- `npm run check` — the standing type gate, three steps: `tsc` (packages) `&& check:site` (the docs site's own tsconfig) `&& check:tools` (`tsconfig.tools.json` — scripts + a2ui tools); all `noEmit`
- `npm test` — Vitest (jsdom), once · `npm run test:watch` — watch mode
- `npm run test:browser` — the real-engine gate, FOUR SEQUENTIAL shards (packages:components →
  packages:rest → site → visual; GH #41 — never re-monolith it or add a heap bump; a single shard
  nearing the default ceiling splits further — the packages project itself split 2026-07-19 after
  crossing the ceiling, measured red on main pre-diff)
- `npm run dev` / `npm run build` — the docs site (`site/`) is the app entry; build live since the
  ADR-0077 wave, incl. the G8 `<component-gallery>` (`gallery.html`)

`tsc` only type-checks (no emit); `check` + `test` are the gates that must stay green.

## Layout

npm-workspaces monorepo; source lives under `packages/agent-ui/*`.

- `packages/agent-ui/components/` — `@agent-ui/components`, the whole framework. `src/` layers (downward-only):
  - `reactive/` — signals kernel; imports nothing (bottom layer)
  - `dom/` — `UIElement`/`UIFormElement`, props, template, directives; imports only `../reactive`
  - `traits/` — `(host, opts) => cleanup` traits + controllers, invoked directly from `connected()` (no `host.use()`)
  - `controls/` — `ui-*` FACE controls; one folder per component; self-define on import
- `packages/agent-ui/shared/` — `@agent-ui/shared`, cross-cutting tokens/styles/utility types. Color
  `tokens.css` adopted (`src/tokens/`, exported as `@agent-ui/shared/tokens.css`); dimensional/runtime tokens land G5
- `packages/agent-ui/a2ui/` — `@agent-ui/a2ui`, the A2UI layer (team-led; docs on the unified map — `.claude/docs/{spec,lld,prd}/`); depends on `@agent-ui/components`. Export surfaces: `.` (renderer/validator/catalog) · `./examples` (seed shelf) · `./corpus` (pure store) · `./agent` (the NODE-FIRST producer toolkit — `buildSystemPrompt`/`produce`/the `AgentTransport`+`Session` seam/mini-skills; ADR-0137/TKT-0072, portable core in `src/agent/`, the key/dev-proxy/registry shell stays site-internal in `tools/agent/`; the root `.` barrel carries zero producer bytes)
- `packages/agent-ui/a2a/` — `@agent-ui/a2a`, the A2A (Agent2Agent) protocol layer: wire types + validation pinned to spec v0.3.0, the tic-tac-toe arena (isolation-proven agent-vs-agent matches), and its own concept/demo corpus shards; zero deps
- `packages/agent-ui/icons/` — `@agent-ui/icons`, swappable icon-pack adapter (pure core + `./phosphor` subpath; ADR-0065/0066); zero deps
- `packages/agent-ui/app/` — `@agent-ui/app`, app-surface compositions (`agent-app-shell`, ADR-0082..0084); depends on components + a2ui + shared
- `packages/agent-ui/router/` — `@agent-ui/router`, a memory-first SPA router with opt-in URL reflection
  (ADR-0115): `createRouter`/`connectUrl` core (zero DOM dependency) + `ui-router-outlet`/`ui-router-link`;
  depends only on `@agent-ui/components` + `@agent-ui/shared`; catalog-invisible by construction (never
  imported by `a2ui`)
- `packages/agent-ui/code/` — `@agent-ui/code`, the code+prose family (ADR-0119): a zero-dep core (token
  types + a swappable highlighter registry + a light-DOM projection seam, `.`) plus three opt-in subpath
  packs — `./highlight` (seven hand-rolled tokenizers, self-registering), `./markdown` (`ui-markdown`,
  rendering the agent-common markdown subset into real fleet DOM, sanitized by construction), and `./editor`
  (`ui-code-editor`, the editable-first FACE source editor — the ONE ruled zero-dep exception: it adopts
  CodeMirror 6, declared in `code/package.json` and LAZY-loaded per mount, ADR-0139; the default barrels stay
  CodeMirror-free); depends only on `@agent-ui/components` + `@agent-ui/shared` (+ the CodeMirror runtime deps,
  confined to `./editor`); a sibling branch off `components` alongside `router`, catalog-invisible by
  construction (never imported by `a2ui`)
- `.claude/docs/` — plan, goals, process, references, adr, prd, spec, lld, decompositions, tickets, rubrics, archive (agent-scoped project docs; the doc grammar + status law: `.claude/skills/agent-ui-doc-standards/`) · `*.test.ts` co-located with source. `tickets/` is a FROZEN historical archive (98 files through TKT-0096) — new work items route to GitHub Issues instead (ADR-0145): the decision/contract tiers (ADR/PRD/SPEC/LLD) and living-state docs (PLAN/ROADMAP) are never delegated, they stay files on this map, always; only the TICKET tier moved. File via `gh issue create` (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/{feature,bug}.yml` mirror the old section contract); `kind` is the `bug`/`enhancement` label (GitHub's own defaults — Issue Types isn't available on this personal-account repo, ADR-0145's build-time amendment), `size` is `size:small`/`size:big`, `status` is Issue state + close-reason (`completed`/`not planned`) plus a `doing` label for in-progress, and Findings write-back is a dated Issue comment.

## Conventions (non-obvious only)

- tsconfig is strict in load-bearing ways: `erasableSyntaxOnly` bans `enum`/`namespace`/decorators
  (use `as const` objects + literal unions, and `declare`-merged accessors instead of decorators);
  `verbatimModuleSyntax` ⇒ `import type` for type-only imports; `allowImportingTsExtensions` ⇒ keep
  the explicit `.ts` on local imports.
- Vite 8 is Rolldown-based (not esbuild/Rollup) — bundler/plugin behaviour follows Rolldown-Vite.
- Imports point inward only: layers `reactive` ← `dom` ← `traits`/`controls`; cross-package the DAG is
  `shared` ← `components` ← `a2ui` ← `app`, with `router` AND `code` as sibling branches off `components`
  (`shared` ← `components` ← {`router`, `code`}) — neither `router` nor `code` imports `a2ui`; `a2ui` never
  imports either, and `app` may import `code` (the editor surface, ADR-0139) but never `router`
  (catalog-invisible by construction, ADR-0115/ADR-0119) (`icons`/`a2a` import nothing). Nothing imports
  upward. (Enforced by the per-package `layering.test.ts` trip-wires.)
- Naming: tags `ui-{name}`, classes `UI{Name}Element`, tokens `--ui-{name}-*` / color roles
  `--md-sys-color-{family}-{role}` / type scale `--md-sys-typescale-{role}-{size}-*` (ADR-0078);
  event names ∈ `change · input · select · open · close · toggle`.
- Components are light-DOM by default; ARIA via `ElementInternals`, never host attributes; no native form elements.
- Props are typed signals via `static props` + `ReactiveProps<typeof props>` (plan §5).

## Always

- Run `npm run check && npm test` green before treating a change as done — judge gates by EXIT CODES,
  never by grepping output (a piped grep-count masked a red `check` and an OOM'd browser run, 2026-07-19).
- A fresh worktree WITHOUT its own `npm install` resolves `@agent-ui/*` through the MAIN checkout's
  node_modules (import-resolving tests/builds silently exercise main's sources, and Vite's fs-allow
  denies `?raw` modules) — install in the worktree and `readlink node_modules/@agent-ui/shared` before
  trusting any import-resolving gate.

<!-- Coherence gates (naming/layering/contract-drift/size/zero-native) are scripts + a planned Stop/pre-commit hook, NOT prose rules — see .claude/docs/process.md §1. Enforcement lives there, not in this file. -->
<!-- Architecture detail lives in .claude/docs/plan.md; the buildout sequence + DoD in .claude/docs/goals.md — referenced as paths, not @-inlined, to keep standing context thin. -->
