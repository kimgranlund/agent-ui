// produce.ts — LLD-C3 / SPEC-R4/R5/R7, ADR-0070: the bounded runtime loop (streaming LLD-C2 realized).
//
// retrieve exemplars → build the catalog-derived prompt → generate via the injected AgentProvider →
// PEEL a leading meta-line (ADR-0088 §1, before heal/validate) → heal + validate the REMAINING A2UI text
// (the SHARED surfaces, no fork — SPEC-N3) → on failure feed the validator's structured failures back →
// bounded at maxRounds → VALIDATE-THEN-STREAM (yield the meta-line, if any, then ONLY a fully validated
// payload's JSONL lines; SPEC-R5) → halt-and-report at the bound, emitting NOTHING invalid. A note-only
// round (a meta-line with zero remaining A2UI lines) is a CLEAN success, not a halt (ADR-0088
// Consequences: empty ≠ invalid). The deterministic gate is the whole runtime verifier; there is NO
// runtime rubric-grading round (ADR-0070 — the a2ui-payload rubric is authoring/eval-time).
// Provider-agnostic: `deps.provider` is the injection point (a stub in tests, an adapter in the proxy),
// so the loop mechanics are gate-covered with no live model.
//
// ADR-0090 §1/§4: `ProduceOptions.mode` (a `GenUiMode`, alongside `maxRounds`/`model`/`k`) threads
// straight to `buildSystemPrompt` — the same per-turn-tuning-knob path `model` already proves. Absent
// `mode` ⇒ `buildSystemPrompt` receives `undefined` ⇒ its default/zero-regression composition; nothing
// else in the loop (peel/heal/validate/stream) reads or branches on it.
//
// ADR-0091 §2: `selectMiniSkills` runs ONCE per turn, right beside `deps.retrieve(query)` — the SAME
// pre-loop position, because `system` is built ONCE outside the round loop and never rebuilt per round.
// Its result feeds `buildSystemPrompt`'s 4th parameter; an empty/no-match selection composes no new
// block (ADR-0091 Acceptance). The registry (`MINI_SKILLS`) is a static committed module, not an
// injected `ProduceDeps` surface — unlike `retrieve`, it has no store/snapshot to inject.
//
// ADR-0097 §1/§3: the model may additionally author an `ask` on the SAME leading meta-line — a feed-
// embedded ask declaration (`{surfaceId}`). Two produce-layer checks gate it, both AFTER the shared
// validator passes (never a fork of `validateA2ui` itself, SPEC-N3):
//   (a) ASK INTEGRITY (never a retry — a silent degrade): an `ask` naming a surface no payload line
//       creates, or colliding with a surface already known to THIS session (a prior turn's own emitted
//       `createSurface`), is DROPPED from the outgoing meta-line — the note stands, the turn ships
//       exactly as if no `ask` were authored (ADR-0089's prose-ask degrade path).
//   (b) FEED SCOPE (a self-correct round, like a validator failure): every component type on the
//       ask-routed surface must be a member of `FEED_SURFACE_TYPES` (`feed-catalog.ts`, the single
//       source SPEC-R15 gates) — a violation feeds the failure back as a produce-layer-only `'FEED_SCOPE'`
//       literal (never joining the protocol's closed `ErrorCode` union) and retries, never streams.
//
// ADR-0146 F1/F3: when the caller opts in (`opts.progress === true` — absent ⇒ BYTE-IDENTICAL to before,
// the note-only/halt/every-deterministic-gate guarantee), the loop also INTERLEAVES live-turn lifecycle
// progress on the SAME stream — `{"a2uiMeta":{"progress":{stage,...}}}` meta-lines yielded AS THEY HAPPEN,
// strictly ahead of any content line. produce() composes the provider's `onEvent` signals (`started` on the first message_start/
// content_block_start; `reasoning` on a thinking delta) with its OWN loop stages (`sent` before each
// request; `content` on the round's OWN first text fragment — produce() is that stage's one pinned emitter;
// `validating` after accumulation; `retry` with the attempt ordinal on a self-correct round; `done` before
// the final yield). VALIDATE-THEN-STREAM is UNTOUCHED: progress is not content — it never enters
// heal/validate/corpus and no A2UI content line ever precedes validation (SPEC-R5). `progressDetail`
// ('stages' default) keeps raw thinking text OFF the wire; 'full' forwards bounded excerpts (F3).
