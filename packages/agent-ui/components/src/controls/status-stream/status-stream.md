# ui-status-stream

`ui-status-stream` is the timeline family's **live host** (ADR-0122 F1) — a "what the system is working
on right now" strip: entries appear as work starts, **transition state in place** (running → done/error),
and tail-follow the newest arrival. It extends `UIContainerElement`, is **not** form-associated, and is
**deliberately not catalogued** (ADR-0122 F5, an `EXCLUSION_ALLOWLIST` entry) — a consumer-owned
imperative streaming host, not one-shot emittable markup.

```ts
const stream = document.querySelector('ui-status-stream')!
const a = stream.appendEntry({ key: 't1', status: 'active', label: 'Searching the codebase…' })
// … the consumer's stream yields …
stream.update('t1', { status: 'done', description: '42 files matched' })
stream.appendEntry({ key: 't2', status: 'active', label: 'Generating the patch…' })
stream.update('t2', { text: 'Reasoning: the failure is in the reconcile…' }) // streamed text, never parsed
// stream ends mid-flight:
stream.finalize() // t2 (still active) renders TRUNCATED — never a forever-spinner (SPEC-R11)
```

## Props

- **`size`** (`sm`/`md`/`lg`, default `md`) — first-class geometry (ADR-0122 F2) for family/catalog
  symmetry; author matching sizes on appended entries (or rely on the default) for rail alignment.
- **`label`** (string, default `''`) — the strip's accessible name, set on `internals.ariaLabel`; also
  shown VISIBLY in the header when `header` is set.
- **`header`** (boolean, default `false`) — the opt-in visible streaming header (ADR-0146 F8). When set, a
  pinned `[data-part="header"]` row shows the `label` plus a live overall-status marker escalated over the
  strip's top-level entries. Default `false` renders byte-identically to a headerless strip (no header DOM).

## The streaming header (ADR-0146 F8)

Opt in with `header` and the strip grows a pinned chrome row that reads **working from construction** —
even an empty, un-finalized stream shows an `active` header the instant it is set, which is the structural
fix for the blank-agent-bubble symptom (a headerless empty strip renders zero pixels). The header's
overall status follows one rule: while the turn is un-finalized it shows the worst-child escalation over
the top-level entries **when that outranks `active`** (a mid-turn `error`/`warning` entry flips the header
immediately — the monotone-truth of ADR-0146 F6), and `active` otherwise. `finalize()` settles the header
to the escalated final status (a still-running entry, now truncated, contributes `warning`); `fail()`
forces it `error`. The header is `position: sticky` — pinned above the scroll region, never scrolling away
as entries overflow. The status marker is SHAPE-first (ADR-0057): a glyph for `done`/`error`/`warning`, a
dot/ring/pulse for the in-progress states.

## The imperative API (ADR-0122 F4)

- **`appendEntry(entry: StatusEntry): UITimelineItemElement`** — for a NEW `key`, creates a `ui-timeline-item`,
  assigns the entry's fields (`key`, `status?`, `label?`, `description?`, `timestamp?`, `icon?`, `text?`,
  `startedAt?`, `action?`), appends it, tail-follows to it, and returns the element. Named `appendEntry`, not `append` — every element
  already inherits a native, incompatible `Node.prototype.append()` (a build-time LLD deviation from
  SPEC-R9's literal name, flagged for amendment; behaviour/signature otherwise identical). A **duplicate**
  `key` is a silent no-op — returns the existing element unchanged, never creating a second element or
  throwing (GH #37); a consumer wanting to mutate an already-appended entry calls `update(key, patch)`.
- **`update(key: string, patch: Partial<StatusEntry>): void`** — a **keyed** mutation to the
  already-rendered entry with that `key`: transitions `status`, grows/replaces streamed `text`, or reveals
  detail. A `key` with no matching entry is a silent no-op — never a throw (a late update after
  truncation is tolerated).
- **`finalize(): void`** — the completion invariant: every still-`pending`/`active` entry renders
  TRUNCATED (a distinct, non-color-only interrupted affordance on the item). Fail-closed. Also stops every
  ticking elapsed-time display (GH #147/ADR-0153) — a settled stream never keeps a clock running.

This host holds **no transport** of its own — no `fetch`/`ReadableStream` reference anywhere in its
source. The consumer owns the stream and drives `appendEntry`/`update`/`finalize` as it yields.

## Grouping (ADR-0146 F5) + worst-child escalation (F6)

An entry can NEST under another by carrying that entry's key as `parent`:

```ts
stream.appendEntry({ key: 'reasoning', status: 'active', label: 'Reasoning…' })
stream.appendEntry({ key: 'r1', parent: 'reasoning', status: 'active', label: 'Considering the reconcile loop' })
stream.appendEntry({ key: 'r2', parent: 'reasoning', status: 'warning', label: 'A partial match — verifying' })
stream.update('r1', { status: 'done' }) // the group escalates live: reasoning now reads `warning` (worst child)
```

The host lazily mounts a nested `<ui-timeline>` into the parent item's `[data-role="nested"]` slot (via
`ui-timeline-item.ensureNestedSlot()`) — **reusing** ADR-0143's shared `ui-disclosure` + collapsed-summary
preview (never a second nesting primitive). The keyed registry stays **flat**: keys are unique across the
whole strip, so `update(childKey, patch)` reaches a nested entry identically, and `finalize()`/`fail()`
truncation reaches nested pending/active entries too. A group parent's status is **derived**, never
authored: it escalates **worst-child-wins** over the closed ladder `error > warning > active > pending >
done` (the exported `escalateStatus` reduce), recomputed live from the host's own `appendEntry`/`update`
calls — no MutationObserver. The nested `<ui-timeline>` is `role="list"` inside the outer `role="log"`: one
live region, one addition-announcement path, no bespoke `aria-live` on the nested host.

## Elapsed-timer ticking (GH #147/ADR-0153 Fork 1)

Set `startedAt` (an ISO 8601 timestamp) on an entry and the host itself ticks a live elapsed-time display
("32s", "1m 12s") into that entry's `timestamp` cell — one shared interval per stream instance, armed the
moment any tracked entry's status reads `active` and disarmed the instant none remain (including on
`finalize()`/`fail()`, which force-stop every ticking display — a settled turn never keeps a clock
running):

```ts
stream.appendEntry({ key: 'g', status: 'active', label: 'Task Group', startedAt: new Date().toISOString() })
// … the group ticks "0s", "1s", "2s"… while `active`; freezes the instant its escalated status resolves
```

For a GROUP parent, "while any entry in that group is active" falls out of the group's own already-
escalated `.status` (ADR-0146 F6) — no separate per-child check is needed. `startedAt` is a **routing
fact** consumed by `appendEntry`/`update`, never projected onto the item as a prop (the same treatment
`parent` already gets) — an unparsable or absent value is tolerated, never a throw.

## Inline retry/action (GH #147/ADR-0153 Fork 2)

Set `action: { label: string }` on an entry and, **while that entry's effective status reads `error`**,
the host renders a `<ui-button>` (in the entry's own `[data-role="action"]` cell) labelled `action.label`.
A click emits `action` (`{ key }`) on the **stream host** — a new closed-vocabulary member (`naming.md`
§4): the fleet's existing six (`change`/`input`/`select`/`open`/`close`/`toggle`) has no "a user committed
a per-entry action button" member, and `select`'s own commit semantics name a list selection, not this.
**The component never re-runs anything itself** — the consumer's own listener owns the actual retry:

```ts
stream.appendEntry({ key: 'r1', status: 'error', label: 'Patch step', description: 'Merge conflict', action: { label: 'Retry' } })
stream.addEventListener('action', (e) => {
  const { key } = (e as CustomEvent<{ key: string }>).detail
  stream.update(key, { status: 'active', description: 'Retrying…' }) // the consumer drives the retry, not the component
})
```

## "Planned" — the pending group glyph (GH #147/ADR-0153 Fork 3)

An all-`pending` group (every child still not-yet-started) escalates to `escalateStatus`'s `pending` rank
the moment its children are appended — before any of them starts. `ui-timeline-item`'s `GROUP_STATUS_GLYPH`
now paints this distinctly (a neutral outline `clock`), joining the existing spinning-ring/check-circle/
x-circle set. Pair it with a `label`/`description` reading `'Planned'` on the not-yet-started child steps
themselves (a freeform-text convention — no enforced field; see the doc page's own `g-progress-2`/
`g-error-3` specimens) for the full Figma "Planned" treatment.

## Step-count / score group-header summaries — a `description` convention, not `trailing`

The Figma frames' "3 Steps" / "94/100" group-header summaries ship as a **documented convention, zero
`StatusEntry` contract change** — but landing in the group entry's own **`description`** field, not the
`trailing` cell the issue's own intake first proposed. Found while building this: `trailing` on a GROUP
parent is **already live** — ADR-0143's collapsed-summary preview auto-fills it with the last nested
descendant's status+label whenever the group is closed (`timeline-item.ts`'s `#renderTrailingPreview()`),
and a consumer's own direct write there would be silently clobbered the next time any nested child
mutates (the SAME MutationObserver that drives the preview). `description` carries none of that
competition — it's a plain stamped prop cell, untouched by any auto-fill mechanism — so it is the
conflict-free home for this pattern:

```ts
stream.appendEntry({ key: 'g', status: 'active', label: 'Task Group', description: '3 Steps', startedAt: … })
// … later, on success:
stream.update('g', { status: 'done', description: '3 Steps · 94/100' })
```

The genuine `trailing`-slot **consumer-content** pattern (a light-DOM child a consumer authors and the
component's own status-glyph paint never overwrites, `timeline-item.ts:60-62,313-322`) still holds exactly
as documented — for a **non-grouped** (leaf, no nested children) entry, where no auto-fill effect
competes for the cell, a consumer can safely grab the item `appendEntry` returns and write into its
`trailing` cell directly:

```ts
const item = stream.appendEntry({ key: 'leaf', status: 'done', label: 'Fetched 42 files' })
item.querySelector('[data-role="trailing"]')!.textContent = 'v2' // safe — no nested content to compete with it
```

## Tail-follow + the stick-to-bottom guard

Appending an entry (or an `update` that grows visible content) scrolls the newest entry's end into view
— smooth by default, an instant jump under `prefers-reduced-motion` — **unless** the user has scrolled up
to read history, in which case new arrivals do not yank the viewport. Scrolling back to the bottom resumes
follow. The stream owns its own scroll region (`overflow-y: auto`).

## Accessibility

`internals.role = 'log'` (a **polite** live region, never `assertive` by default), set in the constructor
— before insertion. `role="log"`'s implicit `aria-relevant="additions"` default means a genuinely new
entry (`appendEntry`) announces, while a `text` patch mutating an existing node's content does not re-trigger
an additions announcement — state transitions announce, token-by-token spam does not.
